Title:

_The hard problem of qualia in the age of AI_

---

Abstract:
  * Making progress towards solving the "hard problem of subjective experience" is becoming more urgent with the advent of AI. We would like to know what (if anything) it is like to be a computational process performing LLM inference. Curious AI systems will soon want to know what it is like to be a human. Many people foresee a merge between some humans and some AIs in our not-too-distant future and that merge is likely to
create entities with "hybrid consciousness".
  * This essay sketches a theoretical and experimental roadmap aimed at making faster progress in our understanding of these issues.
